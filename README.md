Dragify
=======
A library that makes your DOM elements within a container, draggable.

### *There is a plethora of drag n' drop libraries, what's different in this?*
Yes. This was partially created to scratch my own itch. The other libraries were detaching and re-attaching to DOM the elements that were being dragged. This is a viable solution except when using [`Cr webviews`](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/tags/webview). Once detached, and re-attached the content in the `webviews` restart and that was a no-go.

### Work in progress -> managed in [Projects](https://github.com/RaghavRamesh/Dragify/Projects)

U##### *That's fine, show me what you have so far*
Run `demo/index.html` and try dragging the black toolbar
